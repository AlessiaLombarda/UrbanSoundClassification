   abstract = {The rapid increase of information imposes new demands of content   management. The goal of automatic audio classification and content   description is to meet the rising need for efficient content management.    In this thesis, we have studied automatic audio classification and content   description. As description of audio is a broad field that incorporates   many techniques, an overview of the main directions in current research is   given. However, a detailed study of automatic audio classification is   conducted and a speech/music classifier is designed. To evaluate the   performance of a classifier, a general test-bed in Matlab is implemented.    The classification algorithm for the speech/music classifier is a k-Nearest   Neighbor, which is commonly used for the task. A variety of features are   studied and their effectiveness is evaluated. Based on feature's   effectiveness, a robust speech/music classifier is designed and a   classification accuracy of 98.2\% for 5 seconds long analysis windows is   achieved. },
