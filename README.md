# UrbanSound8k Classification 

The goal of this project is to create different architectures that perform classification on the UrbanSound8k dataset {metti link}.  
The specifics of each architectures and the methodologies of experimentation are better exposed in the report {link report}.

## Project structure

Google Colab was used to perform all the computation.  

The *UrbanSound8k_preprocessing* file contains the preprocessing of tha dataset, various examples of the features considered to train the different models and feature selection methods.  

In the *Models* notebook are illustrated the different MLP and CNN architectures, implemented using Tensorflow2, used to address the classification task.
